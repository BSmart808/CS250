How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- Understanding the requirements and expectations of the end users, turning them into functional specifications, and then developing software that meets those specifications is key. This process involves gathering requirements through interviews, surveys, and observations.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- To start, thoroughly understand the requirements of the software through concetoption. Once thats clear, inception is next. We need to design the solution. Iteration is next, creating high-level architecture, designing the user interface, and defining the data structure just to name a few.
  Testing is important as it is an essential part of the process. Afterwards, maintenance will allow the team to effectively update and maintain the product after release Through Scrum, work can be organized effectively and all processes can be understood through sprint planning, daily stand ups, and sprint reivews
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- A good team member requires communication, collaboration, problem-solving, adaptability, must continuely learn, and excel through team work. These are core traits and behaviors that contribute to the success of the team and the quality of the software.
